## Background
Interested in internet statistics and really wanting to learn d3.js... 
For more background see:  http://janvandermeiden.blogspot.nl/

## History
Always procatinated learning d3...
Stumbled on data regarding internet penetration and thought it nice to plot that.

## Current status
Not yet satisfied with the population density and internet density views, color could be better. Area data for Belgium and South Sudan is often missing.
Want to improve the slider control (add a 'run' button).

Longing to plot much more data from the world bank.

Want to add other chart types for different views on the data.
